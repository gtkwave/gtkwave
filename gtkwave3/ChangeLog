3.0.0	01may06	Initial release after promotion from 1.3.86 in order to reduce
		confusion with 2.x series.
		Added user's manual pdf file to distribution in doc/.
		Added vertex and rtlbrowse for sourcecode annotation.
3.0.1	09may06	Automatically add extensions to save filenames in gtkwave.
		Cygwin compile fixes.  Add Cygwin functionality for fork() 
		related ops that do in fact work properly.
3.0.2   09may06 More fixes for full function (except pthreads) in Cygwin.  
		Requires usage of Cygserver if rtlbrowse is to work.
		Fixed fonts for Cygwin to improve readability.  
		The Courier font is very bad looking and blitter mangled under
		cygwin.
3.0.3	29may06	Changed yylineno references in vlex.l in rtlbrowse to 
		my_yylineno as newer versions of flex automatically define 
		this and cause duplicate symbols.
		Saw there were still problems with courier on debian.  Also
		check for misc-fixed on non-cygwin systems just in case.
3.0.4	30may06 Added busy watch (hourglass) for long ops that lock the GUI.
		Fixed replace function in treesearch_gtk2 so it doesn't
		simply replace with the last signal.  (Iterator shouldn't
		be used the way it was.)
3.0.5	08jun06 Reworked tree structure code to handle new tree layout
		such that strings are embedded at the end of struct.  This
		reduces memory usage overall.
		Added in implicit hierarchy split on pipe character in
		symbol names as these only really happen in netlists that
		have escaped identifiers.
		For vzt and lxt2 loaders added block allocation of symbols
		and nodes during init in order to allow denser memory
		allocation as the bookkeeping overhead between allocations
		internal to malloc() is unnecessary as the number of
		elements is known at the outset.  Also removed hashing in
		aet2, lxt, lxt2, vzt as sym[hv] is unused on sorted facs.
		Removed unnecessary strlen() calls after sprintf() in the
		dumpfile loaders as the string length is known from the rc
		of sprintf.
		Fixed T_SCOPE rule in vcd.c as dotted hierarchies would
		throw off the parser as hierarchies themselves are 
		(in practice) never really escaped.
		In tree.c, treenamefix() would recurse more than necessary
		such that some dotted hierarchies would cause an order of
		n squared recursion and as such never complete running
		due to the size of the hierarchy.
		Found non _2 versions of memory allocate/free being used
		in various non-library places.
		Fixed signal aliasing problems in GHW traces that have
		memories or aliased signals in ghw.c.
		Added handling for e8 datatypes and arrays in ghwlib.c
		and ghw.c.
		Updated ghwlib.c and main.c in order to handle gzip or
		bzip2 compressed files.  Extension can be .ghw, .ghw.gz,
		or .ghw.bz2 and the file will be handled properly.  Note
		that as the matchword is consulted, just .ghw can be used
		to specify a gzip or bzip2 file implicitly.
		Added ghwdump and ghwdump.1 to the distribution (from ghdl)
		as it is helpful for debugging ghw file failures.
3.0.6	14jul06	Added "Real" option for data type display as passing around
		real numbers in Verilog across modules needs to be done
		with $realtobits and $bitstoreal.
		Added scripting command flag --script in order to allow 
		autosetup of things that are outside of config file control.
		This also allows doing things such as automated print jobs.
		Added --nowm to remove window manager control on most
		windows the viewer brings up.
		Added --xid to allow turning the viewer into a plug-in for
		calling by foreign applications.  This will allow integration
		of the viewer into a single window for example, with IDEs.
		Added --nomenus to remove menus for the case when used in
		conjunction with --xid and it is desired to create an
		embedded wave viewer applet that cannot initiate file I/O
		on its own.  Note that earlier versions of GTK+ cannot 
		handle menu events properly from a GtkPlug.
		Fixed problem with dead memory allocations for GtkColor 
		structs in color.c as found by Valgrind.
		Moved .odt version of the user's guide into doc/ rather than
		the pdf version as this is a sourcecode distribution so the
		original word processor document should be there.  The .pdf
		will still be up on the homepage on the website.
		Added example script (for use with the -S option) in the
		examples/ directory that prints some waves then exits.
		Found problem with directive-based string embedding in older
		gcc compiler versions.
		GTK+-1.2 doesn't handle GtkPlug.
3.0.7   17jul06 Added support for dualview of waveforms using GtkPlug and
		shared memory IPC through use of the "twinwave" front end.
		Updated documentation to add a section on twinwave.
3.0.8	04aug06	Modified order of flags in twinwave as appending flags
		does not work when longopt isn't used.
		Subscripted GtkItemFactoryEntry menu_items for AIX compile.
		More AIX fixes such as conditional alloca.h usage and
		not including getopt.h.
		Removed unused "bus" element from struct fac.
		Added interactive loading of vcd files with the routines in
		vcd_partial.c.  Added shmidcat to the distribition to test 
		this new interactive loading functionality.
		Added real_parameter vartype (Riviera Aldec 2006.6) in all
		vcd loaders.
3.0.9	10aug06	Fixing compiler warnings across various systems.
		Minor speedup in sigcmp() in bitvec.c for EOS detection.
		Fix in vcd_partial.c loader that crashed on interactive
		loads when blank traces are present in the save file.
3.0.10	13aug06	Found inadvertant 64/32 bit conversion in regex.c that was
		from not including "debug.h" header file.
		Missing headers for gcc-3.2.x and earlier dealing with
		select().
		Converted fgetmalloc() to use vlists in order to cut
		down on the backflips and traversal required for the old
		one character per struct method.
		Added VCD recoder that stores the VCD in memory using a
		new recoding scheme rather than histents.  HistEnt structs
		are created as needed.  The old VCD loader is still used for
		--interactive, or if --legacy is used at the command line.
		Added dynamic zlib compression support to VCD recoder and
		vlist_compression_depth rc variable.  -1 disables, 0-9
		mirror zlib compression depths.
3.0.11	12sep06	Updated documentation to include section on VCD recoding
		strategy and LXT (version 1) file format.
		Removed unnecessary mallocs and functions in vcd_recoder.c.
		Cleanup of all warnings with gcc -pedantic in gcc3
		excluding long long integer constant and string constant
		length warnings.
		Disabled splash screen when loading VCD from stdin.
		Cygwin compile fixes (3.0.10 broke the compile).
3.0.12	19sep06	Updated production rule in verilog.g to handle compiling
		parameterized components in opensparc without dying.
		Integrated a lot of compatibility fixes from Peter O'Gorman.
		Actually use config.h for better compatibility now.
		Check for endianness in vzt read/write if XDRs not available
		rather than assuming windows will byte reverse.
		Fixed single time read in vzt_read.c as it wasn't working
		properly in rtlbrowse.
		Added -f (insert args from file) option to vertex.
3.0.13	06oct06	Updated odt file documentation to make chapter-like page
		breaks.
		Updated lxt2vcd and vzt2vcd to emit proper VCD headers for
		other tools that expect them.
		Added attempt_vecmatch() in bitvec.c to match vectors based
		on numbers inside nets in order to match on vectors inside
		of flattened netlist latches (e.g., top.xyz[0:7]_Z).
		Fixed regex compare on illegal regexs that caused viewer
		crash (e.g., when comparing on a single left bracket or
		any other illegal regex).
3.0.14	17oct06	Fixed vztminer and lxt2miner so not specifying -n actually
		works.  Updated manpages and UM for those executables to
		fix description errors.
		Now can snap cursor to named markers--this was overlooked.
		Changed recoder scheme for single bits slightly in order
		to pack 2 more bits in for 0/1 transitions.  This implies
		that 0..31 timesteps can be encoded in 1 byte for the
		common case.
3.0.15	27oct06	Added getopt_long from GNU project.
		Fixed broken compile under GTK1 for rtlbrowse makefile.
		Now can recoalesce bitblasted vectors in rtlbrowse.
		Updated finalize in vcd recoder to add fake 'x' vch for
		non-aliased facilities.  Normally all facs are initialized,
		but noticed that libvcddump doesn't do this.
3.0.16	13nov06	Patches to remove some compile warnings under Cygwin.
		Changed maxdata linker flag for AIX to allow 3.25GB of
		data segment area for AIX5.3.
		Changed unsigned integer splay comparisons in vzt_write.c
		for a slight speedup.
		Updated configure patch scripts to patch over a "LEX = :"
		glitch for AIX5.3 and also to use gcc in AIX for the pccts
		compile because of xlc incompatibilities with it.
		Fixed bug in draw_hptr_trace_vector_analog() that would
		cause crashes on pure real vectors when zoomed out fully.
		Added dynamic tooltips on current marker values for both
		the left and middle mouse buttons (not tested for Win32 
		yet so disabled there).
		Added preliminary support for changing menu accelerators
		through the rc file with an "accel" statement.
3.0.17	27nov06	Fix in vcd recoder for SystemC which doesn't emit time
		zero in the initial dumpvars.  (would be needed anyway for
		dumpers that for some reason don't as the 1st value
		change collapses into the second)
3.0.18  28nov06	Fix in vcd saver for when units are in seconds: keeps 
		timescale of "ss" being used instead of just "s".
		Locale problem in printing of floating point numbers fixed
		by setting up a local fixer routine in config.h for
		availability across all executables.
		Fix in all vcd loaders to handle "port" (along with other
		keywords) that appear in non-keyword parts of the $VAR
		declaration sequence.
		Fixed long standing LXT bug with integer datatype on 
		trivial LXT files.  (Overflow in lt_buf decoder buffer.)
3.0.19	21dec06	More locale fixing with LC_ALL.
		Added user patches from NIIBE Yutaka to remove requirement
		for the GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN flag in GTK2 compilation.
3.0.20	21jan07	Fixed string/real handling in VCD recoder as it did not
		properly add the right-hand side endcaps which would
		crash pattern search.
		Made vcd recoder more robust to be able to handle 'b'
		value changes for string data as well as wires with
		's' type data (for FlashSim).
		Updated strace.c to allow forward/backward on strings and
		reals.
3.0.21	02feb07	Added support for in/out/inout evcd ports generated by
		dumpports in ModelSim.
		Fixed problem with hierarchy being out of order as 
		treegraft needed to be followed by treesort.  This mostly
		impacted recursive hierarchy imports by only allowing
		two signals to import rather than all of them.  Also there
		was an inconsistency with the signal ordering with VCD vs
		the database formats because of this.
3.0.22	19feb07	Bumped up hash size from 65519 to 500009 entries for VCD
		parsers.  
		Bumped up max VCDID fastindex size to 8M entries.
		Now use gperf for verilog datatypes for some speedup in
		gtkwave vcd loaders.
		create_sorted_table() changed to deallocate long names in
		vcd converters as the names are no longer needed once the
		writer has them.
		Fixed GTK1 makefile in src/ as twinwave had pkg-config
		for GTK2.
		Stray getopt.h include in v2l_analyzer_lxt2.h needed to
		be #ifdef'ed with HAVE_GETOPT_H for Solaris.
		XDR library -lnsl explicitly listed for Solaris.
		PATH_MAX set if not defined in verilog.g for Vertex.
		Regenerated configure for setenv()/unsetenv() presence
		which impacts Solaris (use putenv() instead).
		Regenerated configure to handle auto detect of -lnsl, 
		-lrpc, and -lpthread.
		Added -c to file install in top-level makefile (Solaris).
		Use _LARGEFILE_SOURCE value from configure with linux
		rather than assuming it is always 1 with linux.
		Fix to preproc.c in vertex as it was attempting to parse
		directories.  This works ok under linux with EOF but causes
		problems under AIX.
3.0.23	19mar07	Added corresponding va_end() for all va_start().
		Added optional frequency display between markers, also added
		rc variable of use_frequency_display and menu options to
		support this.
		Placed mainbox for marker text label widgets inside an event
		box as this seems to fix the centering problems with GTK2.
3.0.24	02apr07	Fixed makefile generation so 32bit AIX will use >256MB in
		src/helpers.
		Updated vzt2vcd and lxt2vcd so it handles the zero index of
		bitblasted vectors (from ncsim).
		Updated vzt reader so it can re-coalesce bitblasted vectors
		provided the dumped bits are adjacent/in order.
		Minor bugfixes to vztminer and lxt2miner with respect to
		dumpon/dumpoff (don't emit $dumpon/$dumpoff strings as
		that code was leftover from the vzt2vcd).
		Updated manpages for vzt2vcd, lxt2vcd, and vztminer.
		On concatenated vector loads ('#'/':' in savefile), attempts
		to do a load of a monolithic vector on fail.  This is 
		somewhat related to the re-coalesce vectors feature above.
		Implemented reverse of this for monolithic vectors into
		the '#' bitstrand variants.
3.0.25	10apr07	System Verilog with MTI fix for VCD declarations of form 
		$var reg 64 >w #implicit-var###VarElem:ram_di[0.0] [63:0] $end
		...debussy implicitly escapes the varname during loading so 
		gtkwave does it too now for all VCD loaders.
		More System Verilog with MTI fixes: VCD (parameter) vars of 
		length zero are representative of reals with MTI: they don't
		use real_parameter like Riviera does.
		Updated vcd_saver.c to handle saving these implicit-var
		facilities correctly.  Likewise updated lxt-write.c,
		lxt2_write.c, and vzt_write.c to handle correct bracket
		stripping for the [0.0] semantics.
		Modified dynamic resize routine so large escaped names don't
		cause issues with the signal window crowding out the
		wave window.
3.0.26	18apr07	Fixed various compiler warnings discovered from looking at
		Fedora Core compile logs and later compiling against
		Centos/RHEL5.
		Commented out GTK_CAN_FOCUS for scollbars in wavewindow
		as it was causing rendering problems with newer versions
		of GTK.
3.0.27	27apr07	Renamed vertex to vermin to avoid name clashes with
		existing 3D "vertex" package on debian systems.
		Reverted back to using Open Office 2 Beta rather than
		Open Office 2 as it was causing .odt docs corruption.
3.0.28	30apr07	Changed anonymous union in struct Node as it is a
		gcc extension.
		Fixed some vcd parser memory leaks found by Valgrind.
		Moved errno check in vcd parser as it seems that
		the GTK event loop called in splash_sync() calls it
		on gnome 2.18 for some reason (reported by Gentoo
		gtkwave package maintainer).
3.0.29	27may07	Added viewer support for arrays (currently AE2 only).
		Integrated (standard) ./configure scheme thanks to
		Dan McMahill
		Added strdup_2 to debug.c for memory tracking (found
		stray strdup() instances in ghw.c).
3.0.30	24jul07	Removed variable declaration in menu.h that tcc
		complained about (should have been an extern).
		Updated configure.ac to use AC_SYS_LARGEFILE for
		> 2GB file compatibility with older linux systems.
		(This was accidentally left out in 3.0.29.)
		Added ignore_savefile_pos and ignore_savefile_size
		rc variables.  (Requested by Edward Ash.)
		Added ability to specify trace background color in
		filter processes by prefixing the return string with
		?color? as in "?CadetBlue?xor r0,r0,r0".  The colors
		used must already be specified in the rgb.c file.
		Removed check for c++ compiler presence in the
		autoconf.
		Fixed LIBBZ_CFLAGS in .am files that really should
		be LIBBZ2_CFLAGS.
3.1.0	25aug07	Moved to a global context variable management scheme
		for future code expansion.  Reload waveform function
		added which uses context management.  Update user
		manual to include references to reload capability.
3.1.1	20sep07	Fixed crash in hierarchy search reload.  (Wrong
		pointer type introduced from code cleanup.)  Adding
		start of tabbed browsing support.  Put in window
		select focus switching between tabs (e.g., on 
		search windows).  Added locking in main iteration
		loop to detect unexpected context switches and
		fix/report them (wrong operation if it occurs).
3.1.2	24dec07	Compiler warning cleanups from Sun compile logs.
		Added named parameter support to vermin parser.
		Added check for gperf back into configure.ac.
		Added vlist_spill rc variable to control new 
		feature of spilling vlists to a tempfile on disk.
		Fixed vcd loader status bar on files > 2GB.
		Removed non-growable vlists and also finalize
		aliases in order to be compatible with spill.
		Changed vlist allocation scheme to allocate only
		half as much per-block, then the rest when the
		half-way point is reached.  This reduces memory
		wastage to an average of 12.5% rather than 25%
		on uncompressed blocks.
		Added code to pre-process data in vlists through
		an LZ-based compressor.  The can cut down on
		memory usage ever further.  This can be enabled
		with the vlist_prepack rc variable.
		Added --giga option to turn on vlist_spill and
		vlist_prepack from the command line.
3.1.3	13jan08	Added dynamic keypress detection in the Pattern Search 
		Requester so users do not need to press enter for search 
		strings.  Likewise, added the rc variable sst_dynamic_filter 
		to enable the same type behavior for the signal name filter in
		the GTK2 signal search tree.
		Fixed bug where filtered signal names did not reappear on 
		reload.
		Updated user manual as necessary.
		Added "edge" left/right buttons for handy single signal edge 
		detection due to user requests.
		Fixed long-standing backward edge seek bug in pattern search.
		(It would miss the preceeding edge if the marker isn't already
		on one.)
		Added use_standard_clicking rc variable in order to enable 
		"normal GTK" shift/click semantics in the signal window.
		Collapse/uncollapse is now shift-ctrl when 
		use_standard_clicking is active.
		Added prelim dnd for use_standard_clicking mode.
		use_standard_clicking disabled in GTK-1.2 as there are dnd 
		issues.
		Recalculate signal width on reload as sometimes it was missed.
		Added input focus capability to signalwindow.
		Moving menu options to standard GTK accelerator keys.
		Added Ctrl-A/Shift-Ctrl-A handler to the treeview so it acts 
		like the signal window.
		Added left/right scrolling hotkeys in signal window.
		Added use_toolbutton_interface environment variable which 
		enables new user interface at the top of screen.
		More modifications to handle globals swapping in multi-tab 
		mode.
		Update configure.ac to handle library order problem with
		cygwin in rtlbrowse.
		Added scrollwheel support in signal window when focused and 
		standard clicking is active.
		Added "Use Color" and "Use Black and White" (for screendumps)
		View menu options from user requests.
		Fixed help window so it is not editable.  Also do an implicit
		click-to-front for window managers that automatically move
		windows to front when their insides (not decorations) are
		clicked on.
3.1.4	30jan08	Added fix for how dnd gets killed after reload on new
		versions of GTK (e.g., 2.10.14).
		Added dirty_kick in MaxSignalLength that forces usize if
		width is dirty.
		For interpolated analog traces, fixed interpolation at
		end of line so it doesn't cause endpoint to go offscreen.
		Experimenting with track-and-hold fixing.
		Integrated spice3f5 poly interpolation routines, but are
		currently unused.
		Now allow both interpolated+step simultaneously for analog.
		Integrating signal window popup menu code.
		Fixed rendering bugs in coalesced vectors displayed as analog.
		Added resizing options that are windowed to either the screen
		or across all trace data.
		Added enter=OK as a default file chooser response.
		Added DND and standard clicking to GTK1 compiles.
3.1.5	14feb08	Fixed bug in rtlbrowse that causes lxt2 dumps not to be value
		annotated.  (signal match worked for bitblasted nets only)
		Updated rtlbrowse so that it can update dynamically with the
		marker position.
		Added anti-aliased font rendering code.
		Added use_pango_fonts rc variable.
		Updated edge buttons so they can handle multiply selected
		signals.
		Logfile(s) now update on waveform reload.
		MinGW compile fixes.  MinGW crash on reload fixed.
3.1.6	27feb08	Added additional #ifdefs that disable Pango on GTK versions
		less than 2.8.0.
		Added support for optional sideband .aetinfo files when
		using .aet files.  Update interface to rtlbrowse to
		translate time value back to original aet ones.
		Improved x vs X (z vs Z, etc) handling at signal boundaries.
		Changed color scheme where red marks X data similar to how
		it marks U for VHDL.
		Fixed longstanding bug in linear lxts that only occurs if
		integers are present in the lxt dump (length is failed to
		be promoted to 32 during re-chaining).
		Fixed shift-clicking when use_standard_clicking is active
		such that shift-clicks past the last trace when the
		signalwindow isn't fully populated count as a shift-click
		on the last trace.
3.1.7	23mar08	Updated file.c to remove potential file chooser crash in
		the case of a missing save file at the command line followed
		by "write save file as".
		Fixed problem in black and white mode where process filter
		could possible cause colors to be displayed when ?color?
		value escaping is used.
		Fixed problem where primary marker was listed as 0 sec on
		init instead of -- if not set initially from a save file.
3.1.8	06apr08	Added Range Fill option in the data format menu so
		that vectors like address[31:2] will display as a human
		expects to read them.  Fill in can be zeros or ones.
		Added trace flags display at right hand side of signal name
		in mouseover popup window.
		Added more visual feedback in signal D&D window in order
		for users to determine more easily where a drop will insert.
		Reduced visual noise on D&D by not updating screen after a
		cut if a paste also occurs.
		Fixed problem where primary marker was filtered through
		time_trunc() on initialization.  Removed other time_trunc()
		calls causing similar problems as necessary.
3.1.9	20apr08	Added missing init_filetrans_data() to reload function.
		Updated manfiles to get them in line with Debian lintian.
3.1.10	14may08	Added missing adjustment of t->shift in mouseover.c in 
		order to allow the mouseover on shifted traces to display 
		properly.
		Fixed problem with edgebutton going back two edges on a
		combined vector.  (Cut and paste typo from strace.c.)
		Added support for DND from regex search window to the
		signal/waveareas.
3.1.11	18jun08	Compile fix for tla2vcd in MinGW.
		Added #ifdef for HAVE_BZERO for MinGW.
		Compiler warning fixes.
		Added time = -1 endcaps in LXT2+VZT+AET loaders.
3.1.12	14jul08 Compiler warning fixes.
		Fixed crash in vcd recoder for b vs 01xz mixups in
		malformed VCD files.
		Fixed abort on VCD load for malformed size vs 
		[msi:lsi] syntax.  NC does this on arrays of wires.
		Fix to vlist reader with --giga enabled in order to
		handle reads which go off the end of the file.
		(Possible due to how only the amount used in a block
		is actually written to the file in order to save
		space, so the vlist blocks can be overlapping yet
		usable.)
3.1.13	20aug08	Adding compressed hierarchy handling in order to
		reduce memory usage on large bitblasted models.
		This is currently only enabled for the VCD recoder,
		LXT, LXT2, and VZT loaders.
		Fixed some buffer overflows in vectorization code
		(and when vectorization is enabled) in vzt_read.c.
		Modification to autoconf handling for rpc.h.
		Fix for DnD to directly under an expanded comment
		trace.
		Make step_increment equal to 1/10 page_increment
		for the horizontal scroller in the wavewindow.
		Added sticky click semantics for clicks in signal
		window.  To do this in the treesearch_gtk2 file
		will require some additional future work with 
		view_selection_func() and/or signal handling and
		trapping.
3.2.0	16feb09	Fix for strings ('s' type) in recoder.  
		Added timestart command to savefiles which indicates
		what the leftmost position should be on reload.
		Added support for as/zs small timescales as well as
		0.1/0.01/0.001 multipliers which simvision can emit.
		Adding signal name DnD support from external apps.
		Force open tree nodes on initial .sav file read.
		Yet more new warning (-Wall) cleanups.
		Fixed ExtractNodeSingleBit for vectors which do not 
		have a zero in either the msb or lsb (e.g., [1:9]).
		Added support for dragging files into the viewer
		(i.e., dumpfile, savefile, stems file)
		Added DnD of signal names from RTLBrowse source code
		windows	directly into gtkwave.  
		GTK1 compiler compatibility fixes.
		Improved search performance from rtlbrowse initiated
		DnD searches.
		Fixed wave_locale.h for MinGW.
		Fixed longstanding bug with blackout regions
		rendering.
		Integrating embedded Tcl interpreter.
		Fixed bug with unformat time when base time is in
		seconds.
		Added tcl example in examples/ directory.
		Updated -f argument file handling in vermin.
		Updated tcl_helper code so that signalwindow drags of bit-
		blasted vectors are properly re-coalesced for client code
		for the drag.		
		Updated task definition in vermin so that identifiers with
		dots in them can be used as task enable names.
		Fixed problem in vermin preprocessor where defines in 0x0d0a
		terminated lines would insert the carriage return into the
		sourcecode.
		Added synthesis pragmas which mirror synopsys ones to vermin.
		Used gtk_window_set_default_size instead of gtk_widget_set_usize
		in rtlbrowse in order to allow window to shrink appropriately.
		Made size_tag values smaller in logfile.c in gtkwave/rtlbrowse.
		Allow dragging from rtlbrowse window without needing to high-
		light signals first.  This allows single signal drags.
		GCC-4.1.3 with -O3 flag fix for x86_64 on xchgb instruction
		assembler intrinsic.
		Use gtk_window_set_transient_for() on simplereq windows.
		Starting to update environment for rtlbrowse into a single
		integrated window.
		Adjust xthickness/ythickness in toolbars to make images
		take up less space.
		Preliminary support for text searching in rtlbrowse.
		Added rtlbrowse case (in)sensitive searching both directions.
		Fix re-entrancy on file names for file.c file requester in
		gtkwave.
		Add --with-tcl to configure script via tcl.m4 macro.
		Cut down on visual noise during reload.
		Added fix using TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC to get to compile under
		Ubuntu.
		Fixed lost num_cpus variable that wasn't passing through reload.
		Added Cut/Copy/Paste functionality that allows multiple pastes
		rather than destroying the cut buffer on paste.  Cut buffer
		contents will survive after a reload operation.
		Removed translate filter process from mingw32 menu as it
		is disabled in the compile by #ifdef'ing in empty functions.
		Updated shmidcat so it restarts properly when VCD is being
		looked at while sim is running and gtkwave gets ahead of
		the generated VCD.
		Fix crash on invalid node for force tree open during load.
		Added Partial VCD Dynamic Zoom and related zoom_dynamic
		rc variables.
		Added prelim support for export to TimingAnalyzer file format.
		Added mouseover support in signal window which shows full
		facility name.
		Added dynamic update on strings for marker values which keeps
		user from having to press enter explicitly for each one.
		Now allow support for named markers using optional user names
		rather than just 'A'-'Z' labels.
		Added countdown timer to remove dnd cursor if it is onscreen

		Convert capitalization usage on hex values to match that
		of verilog.  (i.e., x = all bits are x, X means some but
		not all bits are x.)
		Change magic number 3 to AN_1 in vtype2().  This was skipped
		by an earlier sourcecode conversion.

		file support as it is obsolete: all scripts are Tcl scripts
		now.
		Integrated user-provided rework of rgb.c.
		Removed local lzma library and now use system xz if 
		available. Old VZT files using -z 2 are no longer readable
		but can be converted using vzt2vcd from an old version of
		gtkwave.

		installed gtkwave.app.
		Fix window resizing / repositioning to work in OSX: block once
		viewer is on second tab, however.
		Added sst_width, sst_vpaned_height, sst_expanded, and
		signals_width tags into save file to allow pane size and
		expander settings to be saved to the save file.
		Add ignore_savefile_pane_pos .gtkwaverc variable.
		Added dumpfile tag to save files.  OSX Finder uses these to
		find the original dumpfile.  This can be done from the command
		line also by specifying --save but not specifying a dump file.
		Added .gtkw as a new save file extension.  When either .sav
		or .gtkw is encountered, the rest of a tab's session adaptively
		follows in expecting it as the save file suffix.
		Added [savefile] tag to save files.  The intended use is to 
		allow reconstruction of relative paths between dump and save 
		file.
		Fixed --autosavename to use .gtkw as a suffix rather than the
		.sav suffix.
		Reworked wave_info and wave_alert icons.  wave_info now
		matches gtkwave.icns.
		Renamed .sav examples to .gtkw.
		Added relative path comparisons for --save so when dumpfiles
		and savefiles move in tandem, a successful load can be 
		attempted.
		Added [dumpfile_mtime] and [dumpfile_size] tags to save file.
		Can now specify just an augmented save file at the command
		line and gtkwave will load both the dump file and the save file:
		this makes launching from desktops easier on Linux.
		Added mime types, desktops, and icons in share/ for gnome.
		Added percentage progress during load for most file types
		in window title bar when splash screen not active.
		Preliminary add of interfacing with GConf via the
		/com.geda.gtkwave directory for keys in GConf.
		Memory overrun fix to symbol.c for Bluespec add from 3.3.11.
		Added --restore command line option to gtkwave.
3.3.30 17jan12	Updated ./configure to add --disable-mime-update flag.
		Fix --optimize for --restore.
		Add [optimize_vcd] savefile tag.
		Disable analog during mutually incompatible mode selection
		(binary, filters, etc).
		Added F/P/T flags to mouseover for the filters.
		Fix problem where ungrab doesn't occur if button pressed + 
		simultaneous reload accelerator key occurs.
		Fix combine direction in transaction filter to down.
		Fix vector analog render/print routine to use skipcnt.
		Fixed transaction filter to cache hptr node if converted
		(i.e., do not place bitblasted in save file if avoidable).
		Fixed min/max of cached autoscaling sizing when number of
		extension traces changes.
3.3.31 30jan12	Added support for native file requesters in OSX Quartz.
		Added support for native alert dialogs in OSX Quartz.
		Clang warning fixes.
		Added missing config.guess and config.sub.
		Allow drag of .gtkw (when viewer still does not have a file
		loaded) to load the corresponding dump file.
		Fix MinGW compiles broken from recent changes.
		Documentation updates.
		Fixed broken ifdef in signalwindow.c that degated savefile
		loading .gtkw dump+save properly if not gconf2 or Mac.
3.3.32 13feb12	Turn off loader messages when Tcl is executing a command.
		Added gtk_print_unix_dialog support for printing to
		real printers by using the "UNIX" type.
		Automatically kill splash screen on reload/new tab.
		Added transaction_args savefile tag and support for passing
		args to transaction filters via the args $comment.
		Added string value of \000 which renders as high-z.
		Integrated alt_wheel_mode code provided by Tom Browne.
		Fixes for some rc file variables to keep them from getting 
		clobbered on 2nd tab opening.
		Warning fixes when compiled on Ubuntu.
3.3.33 27feb12	Scan-build fix in vcd_recoder.c.
		Added $timezero tag to VCD files which allows offsetting all
		the values in a trace to provide ability for negative time 
		values.  Currently only VCD, LXT, LXT2, VZT, and FST support 
		this.
		Fix for timescale 10s and 100s.
3.3.34 12mar12	Fix for marker time deltas when $timezero is used.
		Reduced size of alert requester icons to 64x64 pixels.
3.3.35 04apr12	Polarity fix for vcd_preserve_glitches in rcfile.  Default 
		is no/off. Use yes in the rcfile to enable (e.g., for
		viewing interpolated analog waveforms).
		Added vcd_preserve_glitches support to FST as --optimize
		uses FST.
		Added vcd_preserve_glitches_real (for VCD/FST) rcfile
		variable that turns off deglitching only for real signals.
		This removes the need for #define TRACK_AND_HOLD_FIX and 
		prevents the case where interpolation of an analog waveform
		is deformed as significant data points were removed by the
		VCD or FST loader.
		Fix for do_initial_zoom_fit when file requester used.
		Changed contact address for bug reports.
		Enable mouseover for MinGW.
		Added fstWriterSetParallelMode().
3.3.36	04may12	Fixed destructive string convert in fstUtilityBinToEsc().
		Added support for 01xzhuwl- in fst.c callback interface,
		vcd2fst.c, and lxt.c.
		Added adaptive buffer resizing in FST writer for Linux
		and Mac OSX.
		Fix for realpath() 2nd argument NULL on Leopard.
		Fix for doubles stored in HistEnt fields in ghw
		introduced in 3.3.19.
3.3.37	10jun12	Added patch for savefile.c that corrects an issue in which the
		parser for process filter lines assumed the associated id
		number was always a single digit. 
		Added patch to bitvec.c catches one more case when locating
		bitblasted signals in vcd files created by modelsim. 
		Fix that kills stray pipeio_create() processes on
		pipeio_destroy().
		Additions to extload to handle hier types, component types,
		and signal types.
		Added support for extload files as input filetype in vcd2fst.
		Added -o for extload files to convert to FST.
3.3.38	10jul12	Upgrading vermin parser to handle some > 1995 constructs.
		Propagate -o option into "Open New Window" menu option.
		Change invert function so it does not incorrectly expand into
		the whole nybble when it is < 4 bits. That is, inverting the
		two bit quantity 10 now displays as 0x1, not 0xD.
		Added fstminer.
		MinGW warnings fixes.
		Fixed relative pathnames for gtkw save files in MinGW.
		Fix fstapi reader so it does not leave stray hier tmpfiles
		around in MinGW if reader is never closed.
		Changed twinwave for MinGW so that it does not target two
		panes in a single window.  Something is apparently now
		broken in the GtkSocket/GtkPlug implementation for Win32.
3.3.39	08aug12	Fixed relative pathnames when generated in MinGW and used
		back on Linux.
		Added --output filename option to fst2vcd, vzt2vcd, and 
		lxt2vcd.
		Fix crash on OSX if gtk_widget_set_sensitive is called on
		a separator.
		Fixed OSX version so it looks for .gtkwaverc in the home
		directory and if not found, probes the resource bundle for
		Contents/Resources/examples/gtkwaverc (no dot in the name).
		Added GTKWave User's Guide option to help menu on OSX.
		Added + vs ++ separators for twinwave.
		Dynamic resize fixes.
3.3.40	10sep12	Fixed y-size of splash screen on MinGW with newest version
		of GTK2 (as it could be verified on that version).
		Fixed off-by-one buffer string allocation write overflow
		in calloc_2() call in maketraces().
3.3.41	30sep12	Fix for gtkwave::addSignalsFromList when encountering
		signals of form a.b.MyBus[7:0] and a.b.MyBus[15:8] such
		that brackets aren't stripped.
		Added experimental highlight_wavewindow rc variable which
		allows signals also to be highlighted in the wave window
		using the value for color_grid.
		Added use_standard_trace_select rc variable and related
		menu option.
3.3.42	28nov12	Fix to prevent missing group openings from keeping other
		signals in the viewer that follow from displaying.
		Adding more support for newer constructs in Vermin.
		Added scrollwheel support to rtlbrowse code windows.
		Added fseeko() return checking in fstapi.c to prevent
		errors with dynamically updated files.

		gtk_adjustment_get_step_increment introduced in 2.14. 
		Added VPD support via vpd2vcd.  To use, specify -o
		at the command line.  (e.g., gtkwave -o test.vpd)
		Added autodetect for LXT, LXT2, VZT, FST regardless of the
		filename suffix.
		Crash fix for gtkwave::getDisplayedSignals, specifically
		removing the extra free_2() in WAVE_OE_ME.
		Added conditional compile for stat() being available.
3.3.44	16feb13	gdk_draw_layout assertion `GDK_IS_DRAWABLE (drawable)'
		assertion fix.
3.3.45	28feb13	Fix for VCDNAM_ESCAPE character in treesearch window.  This 
		sometimes occurs for structure identifiers.
3.3.46	29apr13	Upgraded to autoconf 2.69.
		Fixed as of yet undetected hdr_incomplete bug when running off
		end of FST file.  (e.g., while file is being written)
		Fixed problem with is_gtkw_save_file getting wiped out on
		reload.
		Updated Mac bundle info to reflect new autoconf filenames.
3.3.47	14may13	Fix for crash in 64-bit mode with array accesses in
		deprecated loader.
		Partial VCD loader fix for small files.
		Added preliminary do-nothing generate support in vermin.
		Fixed minmax_valid for partial VCD loader: affects scaling
		on floating-point traces.
3.3.48	04aug13	Fixed infinite loop hang on various helpers executables
		when extra arguments are specified.
		Delete changed marker name if it exists when marker is removed.
		Added "Open Hierarchy" option that will expand the SST and
		select the hierarchy for a given signal selected in the
		Signals window.
		Added preliminary support for FsdbReader.
		FSDB fix for generate created hierarchies.
		FSDB fix for new debug info output style to be parsed.
		Added generate as scope type to VCD/FST/FSDB.
		Preliminary add for module port direction for FSDB and FST.
		Display signal direction column in SST if not all signals are 
		declared as FST_VD_IMPLICIT.
		Fixed GTK warning when hide_sst is enabled and SST is opened
		then closed.
		Added extraction of in/out/inout from FSDB into FST with
		vcd2fst helper executable.  (It also converts FSDB to FST.)
		Added support for SV structures, unions, classes, packages,
		programs, and interfaces.
		Updated signal parsing in FST/FSDB to handle NC declarations
		for arrays in VCD.  (i.e., bitranges are missing)  Use vcd2fst
		or the -o option to read NC VCD files with arrays properly.
		Preliminary support for SV datatypes of bit, logic, int,
		shortint, longint, byte, enum, and shortreal in VCD and FST.
		Added sparse array datatype to FST (currently unused by
		gtkwave).
		Added support for attribute begin/end in FST.  (Currently
		unused by gtkwave.)  This allows embedding of various data
		inside the structure tree.
		Added autoraise on entry window on keystrokes or periodically
		when it exists.
		Added ability to store $comment in FST files via the attribute
		mechanism (FST_AT_MISC/FST_MT_COMMENT).

		for VHDL) in FST and gtkwave.
		Removed requirement for fsdbdebug in path when FsdbReader
		is present.
		Fixed ordering of static FSDB libraries for when dynamic ones
		are not present.
		Added direction filters to SST name filter search.  That is,
		adding +I+, +O+, +IO+, +B+, or +L+ before the regular 
		expression adds additional filtering criteria.  Direction
		filters are case-insensitive.
		Relax FSDB loader to allow VHDL and mixed-language files.
		Added VHDL hierarchy types to FST, internal VCD loaders and 
		also vcdfst/fst2vcd.
		Added in VHDL to FST (which will also allow other languages):
		gtkwave can process these types (e.g., signal + std_ulogic), 
		but there are currently no simulators supporting them.  These
		are written by using fstWriterCreateVar2().
3.3.50	15oct13	Limit number of rows that can be displayed in mouseover in
		order to prevent potential X11 crashes on extremely wide
		signals.
		Added "/File/Grab To File" PNG image grab menu option.
		Added missing $dumpvars emission in fst2vcd.
		Added missing atto and zepto time prefix parsing in vcd2fst.

		Added red box around 'U' vector values for VHDL similar to 
		'X' for Verilog.
		Used FST "attribute name" for variable types if specified.
		CRLF fix for save file reading on LF-only systems.
		Fix Valgrind hit in fst.c that was causing crashes on OSX.
		Added fstWriterSetFiletype() and fstReaderGetFiletype()
		to provide sim language hint to gtkwave for language-
		appropriate formatting of various data.
		Added fstWriterSetSourceStem() so writers can embed source
		stems in the FST file.  Specify before the appropriate
		hierarchy or variable declaration.
		Added gtkwave_bin_launcher.sh script to set up environment
		variables on OSX for running the bin/ directory files from
		a terminal rather than as an app invocation.
3.3.51	27oct13	MAINTAINERS: Please add gedit to the list of dependencies
		for gtkwave in order to enable new function that Icarus
		Verilog dumps into FST files.
		Fix "/File/Grab To File" on OSX with an OSX patch as the 
		_gdk_quartz_image_copy_to_image() function in the GTK 
		toolkit for Quartz is broken.
		Updated examples/gtkwaverc accel options to reflect the
		current state of the gtkwave main window main menu.
		Added "Open Source Definition" and "Open Source Instantiation"
		options that invoke .gtkwaverc variable "editor" (or 
		$GTKWAVE_EDITOR or gedit or open -t [OSX]) on sourcecode when
		source stems are present in the dumpfile (currently FST only).
		Fixed timezero in vcd2fst as it was only parsing unsigned
		numbers.
		Fixed Open Hierarchy crash on blank signals.
3.3.52	11nov13	Added LZ4 as compression type for FST.  When enabled with
		--fourpack in vcd2fst, this compresses both signal data
		and the hierarchy using LZ4.
		Added WLF support via wlf2vcd.  To use, specify -o
		at the command line.  (e.g., gtkwave -o test.wlf)
		Changed left/right arrow function in signal/wave windows to
		find next transition of selected signal(s).
		Re-enabled DnD scroll beyond top/bottom of Signals pane.
		Added debounce for baseline (middle) mouse button.
		Another partial VCD loader fix.
		Now use libcomdlg32 file requesters on MinGW.
		Added --extensions flag to fstvcd to enable emission of
		FST extensions/attributes to VCD files.  This is to keep FST
		attributes from making VCD files unparseable with other tools.
		Fix in FsdbReader interface for version 1.x files.
		Many warnings fixes found from gcc -Wextra flag.
		Fixed thread-unsafe static allocations in fstapi.c.
3.3.53	15dec13	Made LZ4 the default compression routine selected for vcd2fst.
		Fixes to EVCD parsing in vcd2fst and evcd2vcd.
		Automatically invoke --optimize if VPD or WLF is detected;
		invoke on FSDB if FsdbReader is missing.
		Standardized export feature to write vcd using lower case
		for non 0/1 values.
		Added perror() on errno-related exits in vcd loaders.
		Added experimental wlf2vcd in contrib.  It is not currently 
		compiled or used.
		Corrected non-functional typos in documentation.
3.3.54	02jan14	Added LZ4 double compression on hierarchy tree for FST when
		hierarchy size exceeds 4MB.
		Fix to regular expression filtering when +I+ form expressions
		are encountered in the SST.  Previously, the wrong value of
		regex match was used on 32-bit architectures due to the
		stack layout.
		Removed --disable-inline-asm ./configure flag as inline
		assembly has been removed because it is generating incorrectly
		in some cases on x86_64.
3.3.55	06feb14	Fixed problem with FST_DYNAMIC_ALIAS_DISABLE enabled when
		Judy arrays are not present.
		FST writer performance tweaks for traces with millions of 
		signal declarations.
		Keep FSDB_VT_STREAM (FSDB transaction type) traces from 
		attempting to be read (for now) as they aren't yet processed.
		Added more space efficient FST dynamic alias encoding.
		Tempfile creation fix for Windows.  Using tmpnam() is not
		enough and fails depending on user permissions.
		Make vcd2fst use FastLZ instead of LZ4 as a default compression
		type if an EVCD file is being processed as it (re-)compresses
		much better.  Using -4/-F/-Z still gives expected results.
		Changed double printf formatting for FSDB to "%.16g" to match
		VCD formatting.
		Added very fast I/O write capability to fst2vcd.
		Added support for FSDB_BYTES_PER_BIT_2B (EVCD) in FSDB loader.

		Fix to regex search to remove duplicate signal names because of
		faulty dumpers.
		Fix to configure.ac for MSYS not adding -lcomdlg32 when Tcl
		is disabled.

		be examined in set_GLOBALS_x().
		Minor cleanup in treesearch_gtk2.c: removed redundant show
		widget invocation.
		Added missing compressBound() for compress2() dest mallocs.
3.3.57	13feb14	Fix for Electric Fence crash in vlist_freeze().

		crashes with read only files.
		Updated man page for gtkwave.1 indicating that XID is in hex.
		Allow decimal conversions on popcnt filtered vectors that are
		greater than 64 bits (they will never overflow).
3.3.60	14may14	Fix MinGW tmpfile_open() patch from previous release as it
		was using the wrong filename.
		Harden fsdb reader against xtags that move backward in time.
3.3.61	27jun14	Parameterized number of named markers, so that
		--enable-manymarkers at configure time allows up to 702
		named markers instead of 26 (disabled by default).
		Updated LZ4 for version r118.
		Fixed broken VCD/TIM export in Windows (broken by new file
		requester).
3.3.62	29aug14	Added zoom_full, zoom_size, and move_to_time to the dbus
		interface (dbus enabled by --with-gconf).
		Updated LZ4 to version r120 (r121 files are the same).
		Compiler warnings fixes for gtk+-1.2 (-Wall -Wshadow -Wextra).
3.3.63	06nov14	Updated LZ4 for version r123.
		Added fine horiz scrolling in wavewindow (when using the wheel
		on a mouse) if shift pressed.
		Timescale fix for Verilator where it emits 0ps as a timescale.
		Added sample gtkwave.appdata.xml file in share/appdata.
3.3.64	25nov14	Fix to FileChooser to prevent requester from blocking on asking
		for a directory if a dumpfile is loaded without some amount of
		absolute/relative pathname.
		Updated LZ4 for version r124.
		Fix for x-windows OSX compiles.
3.3.65	01apr15	Added --, -I-, etc. option to port filtering in SST.  Using
		-- for example filters all non-ports from search results.
		Updated LZ4 for version r126.
		Minor warnings fixes.
                Moved TCL_LDADD/TK_LDADD before	FSDB_LDADD to avoid stale
                Tcl library version conflicts.
		Removed appending [31:0] to vcd loaded integer names.
		Reduced recursion depth in GHW signal loader to prevent
		stack overflow crashes.
		Added support for synthetic clocks in FST file.
		Update timetrace marking so it runs quicker for large traces.
3.3.66	05jul15	Faster fsdb initialization.
		Fix vcd recoder loader crash for malformed vcd if signal is 
		declared as bits and a real valued change is encountered for
		the value change.
		Fixed crash in vcd2vzt for vcd files with no value changes
		(likely a malformed vcd).
		Added fsdbReaderResetSignalList() to prevent signals from
		loading over and over when unnecessary.
		Compile fixes for renamed functions and defines in gtk osx.
3.3.67	24sep15	Updated LZ4 for version r131.
		Fixed right justify ascii datatype display.

		Added named markers capability to From: and To: time value
		input boxes.
		Added support for fixed point binary numbers for both signed 
		and unsigned decimal display types.
3.3.69	03feb16	Added missing EXTLOAD_CFLAGS declarations in configure.ac for
		FSDB detection when only .a files are present (necessary for
		Ubuntu).
		Fixed valgrind warning in fst.c for dead memory allocation.
		Fixed signed fixed point binary number shift for negative
		numbers.
		Added ghw patch for missing enum crash in ghw files.
3.3.70	14feb16	Various warnings fixes from new version of scan-build.
		Crash fix in Windows for transaction traces (broken since
		VCD/TIM export in 3.3.61).
3.3.71	06apr16	Printf format warnings fixes in lxt2_write.c.
		Added SVG gtkwave icon in
		share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/gtkwave.svg directory.
		Make gtkwave interpret values as double precision FP for
		plotting when BitsToReal is enabled. Also keeps analog mode
		enabled when selecting numerical formats (which allows 
		enabling/disabling BitsToReal without going out of analog 
		mode). Disabling analog mode can be done using the
		existing Analog->Off menu option.
		Fix broken non-canonical bit ordering (IBM) single bit
		extraction in process_tcl_list().
		Fixed gtkwave::gtkwave::addSignalsFromList so it can handle
		subset and forward/reverse extractions on signals.
		Remove FST_WRITER_PARALLEL from MinGW CFLAGS as some recent
		versions of MinGW have issues with struct timespec when 
		pthread.h is included.
		Added /Edit/Delete to destroy traces without affecting the
		existing cut buffer.
3.3.72	13apr16	Revert to old gtkwave.appdata.xml as the new one is causing
		problems with appstream-util validation.
3.3.73	11jun16	Added dragzoom_threshold rc variable to accommodate input
		devices that have a noisy 3rd mouse button.
		Fix emission of all filter names so they are emitted in
		canonical fashion so as to avoid growing strings of ../ in
		savefiles.
3.3.74	27jul16	Fix for when a signal name is used as a hierarchy name at the
		same level of scope.  (Affects fsdb.)
		Added --rcvar command line option to insert rc variable changes
		individually without needing to point to a configuration file.
		Change to combine traces down/up routines to handle 2D vector
		name generation.
		Allow FSDB files to contain ".gz" and ".bz2" suffixes as the
		libnffr loader can handle those.
		If a variable is declared in the dumpfile as an integer, then
		it is imported to the waveform display as an integer instead of
		a hex value. This works for dump file formats that show the
		datatype in the SST window.
		Added code that should prevent the primary marker from 
		disappearing unexpectedly as well as dynamic resizing being
		stuck in the unset marker width.
3.3.75	02aug16	Fix crash when -S and -W are used in tandem.
3.3.76	13aug16	Fix for --disable-tcl in ./configure caused by 3.3.75 fix.
		Crash fix in fstapi.c on read value at time accessing of
		FST files that use new dynamic aliases, FastLZ, or LZ4.  This
		primarily affects rtlbrowse.

		implementation details.
		Removed '!A || (A && B)' is equivalent to '!A || B' redundant
		condition checks where found in source.
		Added hier_ignore_escapes rc variable.

		files from crashing Tcl scripts.
3.3.78	26oct16	Fixed crash when using multiple pattern searches.
3.3.79	31dec16	Disable accelerator keys in twinwave single window mode to
		avoid focus conflicts.
		Fixes for -fstrict-aliasing and other recent warnings.
		Added fill_waveform rc variable and corresponding menu option
		(/View/Show Filled High Values) to allow filling in the lower
		portion of high values for increased visibility.
3.3.80	17mar17	Added "/View/Mouseover Copies To Clipboard" menu option to
		allow copying values into the clipboard so they can be pasted
		into text editors, etc.
3.3.81	09jun17	Added max_fsdb_trees environment variable.
		Fixed -C option so it is persistent across new tabs.		
		Integrated updated GHW reader code.
3.3.82	02jul17	Get sys_fst working with VCS VPI.
		Added string concatenations for vectors.
		Added asserts to ghwlib.c to make scan-view clean.
3.3.83	04aug17	Preserve search type for regex search across reloads or
		close/reopens of regex search widget.
		Update local libz to current version.		
3.3.84	03sep17	Updated FSDB reader with experimental FST tree build
		routines for faster init.
		Removed warnings found when compiling with -Wshadow.
		Automatically enable --comphier for FST/FSDB/AE2 if facility
		count reaches 500000.  This is to reduce memory consumption
		for traces with very many signals.  Added disable_auto_comphier
		to override this behavior.
		Fix null pointer sent to gtk_clipboard_set_text() for
		mouseover to clipboard cut ops.
3.3.85	06sep17	Fix integer type in GHW loader so integer value changes are
		not stored as a string. This then allows bitwise manipulations
		of integers.
3.3.86	03oct17	Added recurse import function (found before only in the hier
		search) into the SST.  
		Removed obsolete bundle functionality from SST as recurse 
		import more accurately imports recursively.
		Made entrybox taller (using -1) as recent versions of
		gnome have taller window titlebars and the widget was not
		tall enough.
3.3.87	28dec17	Added missing prototype for ghw_read_sm_hdr in ghwlib.h.
		Made intptr_t changes vs long during casting for win64.
		Warnings fixes.
		Re-enable twinwave for Win32/64.
		Added missing gtkwave_bin_launcher.sh in contrib/bundle_for_osx
		Makefile.am.
3.3.88	20feb18	Added --sstexclude command line option to prune unwanted
