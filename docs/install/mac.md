# Apple Macintosh

## OSX / Macports

An older build of GTKWave LTS for OSX can be found on SourceForge:
[download](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/gtkwave.zip)

However, this version is not compatible with current versions of macOS.
To run GTKWave on newer macOS version this community provided
[Homebrew tap](https://github.com/randomplum/homebrew-gtkwave) can be used.
Additional information about running GTKWave on newer macOS
can be found in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave/issues/250).
